             When I started using VS
            Code, I discovered a lot of features I could use right away. Although it
            is simple to use, knowing a few extra features and extensions can help you
            get things done faster, whether you're coding, writing, or doing both.
            This article provides a beginner's overview, taking you through some
            practical tips, interesting features, including the built-in Git
            capabilities, and a few and extensions, that can enhance your VS Code
            experience. I'm excited to share the tricks and tools I've learned that
            will be beneficial for those just starting out. Keyboard shortcuts Let's
            explore some keyboard shortcuts that can make navigation and editing in VS
            Code quicker. Many of these shortcuts are also supported in other editors.
            For example, if you're familiar with Sublime Text, you'll find that most
            of the shortcuts are quite similar. Learning these shortcuts can help you
            work faster in VS Code, and they'll also be useful if you switch to or use
            another editor.
